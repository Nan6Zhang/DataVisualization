# DataVisualization
Project for Data Visualization course



Part 4. Implementation
In this section, you describe 2 of the visualisations that you created to answer the questions in the brief (see the github README file). For each visualisation, explain the visual encoding and the interactions. Also describe how it relates to the final designs that you mentioned in Part 3: what did you skip, simplify, or add? Include screenshots (with annotations if relevant). You do not have to describe additional plots that you made in e.g. R or Excel to answer the questions; this is about the custom visualisations.
In the description below, we make a distinction between the intended design, and the actual design. The ideal design is what you want to have in the end; the actual design is what you ended up with. See figure below.
Please provide the following for each custom implemented visual:
The intended design that you wanted to implement: a picture (hand drawn or a mock-up) of the design that you aimed for with the implementation. These could be from the diverge-emerge-converge stage earlier, or new ones. Important: they should be chosen based on their possible use to answer the questions mentioned in the project description on github.
The actual design that you were able to implement: a description of the visual encoding of the implemented visual (what does each part refer to; what are the marks and channels). An annotated image/screenshot may be helpful.
A description of the interactions that are possible.
If the implementation does not have all features of the drawn sketch (in other words: if the actual implementation is not the same as the ideal one): how does your implementation relate to the target design? What is not included yet, or what needs to be added still if you had access to a skilled programmer.
A link to the code for the visual (e.g. on github or the svelte repl). Important: the reviewer will NOT be expected to go there, download the code and try it out. This is for archiving purposes and transparency only. Paste the full URL in the document instead of a link that automatically opens the web browser (i.e., http://www.example.com instead of example).
 
As a separate upload: a 4-6 minute screencast in which you (a) demonstrate the functionality of the custom visualisations you created, and (b) how this helps in answering the questions.

Max 4 pages.




Part 5. Findings
In this part, describe the patterns/signals you identified using your visualisations. Use a story-telling approach: which initial patterns did you find when you started on the project using the question(s) that you defined in Part 2 point 3, how did that lead to focussing on specific parts in the data, etc.
Please provide the following:
1. 	A description of interesting findings, including screenshots/images (if necessary/useful: annotated) that illustrate the patterns/insights that you found.
2. 	Where can we optimise? (See the instructions in the project description on github)
 
Max 4 pages.




Part 6. Individual contributions
Only to be completed for the second deadline!

Describe the contribution of each of the different team members: who did what?
Max 0.25 pages.
